## Installation
You can install this magical piece of code only on machines that are running the [rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs).

```

### Install from source

git clone git://github.com/de-sh/binod-rs binod
cd binod
cargo run
```
## Contributions
All contributions are welcome as long as they are compliant with the core principles of binod. I don't know the same, so it seems like there won't be many PRs being merged. If you think your work is not being accepted despite it being some of the best in the world, binod you. Fork the code and probably start a new cult of your own. Otherwise, open an issue and lets discuss how we can take the word of binod to each and every corner of the world.

Binod.
